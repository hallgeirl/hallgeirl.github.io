I’m a software engineer/architect/geek by profession and personal interest. In addition to my day job, I also enjoy making silly and/or useful programs and gadgets on my spare time. I taught myself to code at a fairly young age, and eventually got my master’s degree in computer science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway.

The intention of this blog is for me to share some of the things I’m doing around software development that could be of interest to others, as well as other technology-related topics. As for what this evolves into, we’ll see as time progresses.

Welcome!
