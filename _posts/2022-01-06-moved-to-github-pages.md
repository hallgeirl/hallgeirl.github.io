title:  "Moved my blog to GitHub Pages"
categories: blog github

It sometimes feels like I post more about my blog itself than actually writing content. But that's how it is sometimes I guess. :smile:

Tl;dr: I'm moving my blog from [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

micro.blog is a great platform. However, GitHub is kind of my "home" when it comes to both my hobbies and work. Moving everything to GitHub Pages also brings a more flexibility on how I want my "landing page" on the Internet to look like and contain. I've set up my GitHub Pages repo with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I use the amazing [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme by [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes). By using Jekyll, I don't need no stinkin' backend to store my stuff. The whole blog is mine, and I can take it and host it wherever I like. There's no database to worry about or anything -- just markdown (and some yaml for configuration).

For those that are not familiar with Jekyll, it's a static site generator written in Ruby. I write my posts and pages in markdown, and pages and links are generated by rendering them to HTML. In fact, micro.blog is, as far as I know, powered by Hugo, another static site generation framework. I'm certainly not a Ruby guy - but thankfully there's no need to do any Ruby coding -- only markdown and yaml.

That's it for now!
